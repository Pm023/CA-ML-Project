🌱 Carbon-Aware Machine Learning (CA-ML)

A Green AI–based Machine Learning framework that not only trains ML models but also measures energy consumption and carbon emissions during training and inference.
This project promotes sustainable, eco-friendly AI by combining model performance with environmental impact analysis.

📌 Project Overview

Traditional ML models focus only on accuracy and performance, ignoring environmental cost.
CA-ML solves this by integrating carbon emission tracking into the ML pipeline.
